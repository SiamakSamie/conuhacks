### Take Charge, Give Charge

Three software engineering students, passionate about physical activity, sustainability, and IoT.

Our vision is to incentivize individuals to decrease their carbon footprint, live a healthy lifestyle, and feel rewarded for doing so.

Our hack, consisted of 3 ideas: 1.Turning normal bicycles from public bicycle sharing system into IoT devices that produce and store electricity from being pedaled. 2. Providing direct network communication to these bicycles, via mobile application. 3. Creating a system that allows users to be rewarded for their participation in these networks.
